# springrestcontroller

if we want to add data in api in form of PUT POST ,postman is very helpuful.
used path variables.
also implemented expection handler to handle errors during retreival of data
Expection handler is limited to specific rest controller which cant be used by other controllers
//Global Exception handlers promotes resuse of exception handling and also centralize exception handling
